Then save the bullshit questions Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't Sometimes it's just how the light hits their eyes Do you believe in love?",

All these boys are gonna be your ruin\"  Now I can't help but overhear As I'm kissing from her neck to her ear Well, if any of them meant it I'd mean it back It never meant anything but a case of the clap Girl please let me call you back Why? 'Cause it's all beginning to sound like a rap  Sometimes it's just one of those nights Ain't you never had it happen to you? Then you go home too soon, go home too soon You could blame it on the music But it wouldn't be right 'Cause I've gotten lucky to some pretty bad tunes  Must be the moon Must be the moon  Kissing in the cab on the way back 'cross the bridge She said \"love is love but a fuck is what it is\" \"And what's that?\" She must have read my mind 'Cause she looked into my eyes and she said \"a good time\" She kissed me on the stairs and she kissed me on the porch She kissed me as I fumbled with the key in the front door One time, two times, three times, four But really, who was keeping score? We did it on the bed and we did it on the floor But I was surprised when I got the cold shoulder (The next morning) She said \"you just got me hot, I finished off while you were snoring\"",

         "[Intro] They felt like they were laying tracks, for the generation to come. I think my mother knew that freedom wouldn't come in her lifetime, just like I know it won't come in mine. It's a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more  [Verse 1: Punch] I was taught never trust a nigga, far as you can see him Teach a nigga how to fish, as apposed to try'na feed him Look a man in the eyes, that's the best way to read him Cause faces they change, but point of views remain I got a strange feeling, that I'm a lil bit different Beyond the customs and tradition of a project living My Korean war vet, grandfather's affliction Was stress and I inherited his heart condition And Van Arthur's addiction, was heroin needles Petty hustling, d'evils, that street men lust So I'm mixed with that lethal combination but trust I've only scratched the surface, what's underneath this verse is The feeling of a young boy lost, without a purpose Still waters run deep in the street we were submerged in Police lurking, try'na catch a nigga serving He ain't going back to jail, so he bust a verse [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] This is for my everyday young nigga It don't really matter where you from niggas Before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga Cause you don't know when that day'll come nigga Cause only Lord knows that I know how you feel What we gotta do just to live Is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled  [Verse 2: Punch] It's hard to get to know me, unless you hear between bars Tortured soul self contained on my childhood scars I was involved from a far, affected by the street laws Concrete walls, not even earthquakes could shake them brick walls Nickerson garden projects this is me y'all Where Dope dealers have it all and then freefall Caine numbs the pain up and down the ghetto seesaw The voice of the youth, they hear me and they see y'all They don't see a diamond in the rough, they see flaws They should see how we was raised and they would be in awe Against all it gets hard not to kill niggas It's like a full-time job not to grab the semi-auti And go kamikaze on somebody who plotting Probably on my body laying lifeless, ungodly sacrifices To the streets, this is the trinity Money malice and murder the hood's deity [Hook]  [Verse 3] They say the average black man only lives to 25 Well I made it past that and a nigga still alive Which means I'm in the red, I'm indebted to death That's the wages that sin pay, I'm still tracing my steps Leaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose That grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man My only fear is pops holding moms hand Dripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen By any means avoiding the city traffic Shooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage A young kid turned savage, city madness A picture painted on the street's canvas, excuse my brashness I'm trying to live to see past this Staring at the world and my rear view past tense In no particular fashion, I'm on borrowed time I'mma grind with a passion  [Hook]  [Outro] Generation to generation to come They won't come in mind Sacrifices, sacrifices, sacrifices Deadly circle, deadly circle",

What I saw, clear as light    Jean Valjean in the sewers that night    Had this corpse on his back    Hanging there like a great bloody sack.    I was there, never fear    Even found me this fine souvenir!        [Thenardier shows Marius a ring.]        Marius    I know this! This was mine!    Surely this is some heavenly sign!        Thenardier    One more thing, mark this well    It was the night the barricades fell.        Marius    Then it's true, then I'm right    Jean Valjean was my savior that night!        [Marius hits Thenardier and then throws money at him.]        As for you, take this too!    God forgive the things that we do.        Come my love, come Cosette    This day's blessings are not over yet!        [Marius and Cosette leave.]    ",

You know that's unheard of I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat And my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare We're just technologically impaired  [Bridge] There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar Not a single luxury Like Robinson Crusoe It's as primitive as can be  [Chorus] We been spending most our lives Living in an Amish paradise We're just plain and simple guys Living in an Amish paradise There's no time for sin and vice Living in an Amish paradise We don't fight, we all play nice Living in an Amish paradise [Verse 3] Hitchin' up the buggy, churning lots of butter Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart? Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife So don't be vain and don't be whiny Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie  [Chorus] We been spending most our lives Living in an Amish paradise We're all crazy Mennonites Living in an Amish paradise There's no cops and traffic lights Living in an Amish paradise But you'd probably think it bites Living in an Amish paradise  [Outro] (Ooh, ooh, yech!)",

If you don't know how to conjugate (Woo!) Hey, maybe you flunked that class (Hey, hey, hey) And maybe now you find (Hey, hey, hey) That people mock you online (Hey, hey, hey) (Everybody wise up!)  [Verse 2] Okay, now here's the deal I'll try to educate ya (Woo!) (Ow!) Gonna familiarize You with the nomenclature (Woo!) (Meow!) You'll learn the definitions (Hey, hey, hey) Of nouns and prepositions (Hey, hey, hey) Literacy's your mission (Hey, hey, hey) [Pre-Chorus] And that's why I think it's a good time (Woo!) To learn some grammar (What) Now, did I stammer? Work on that grammar (Woo!) You should know when It's \"less\" or it's \"fewer\" (Woo!) (Oh, yeah) Like people who were (All right) Never raised in a sewer  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes Like \"I could care less\" (Hey, hey, hey) That means you do care (Whoa) At least a little Don't be a moron (Hey, hey) You'd better slow down And use the right pronoun (Hey, hey) Show the world you're no clown (Everybody wise up!)  [Verse 2] Say you've got an \"i-t\" Followed by apostrophe \"s\" (Woo!) Now, what does that mean? You would not use \"it's\" in this case (Woo!) As a possessive (No, no, no!) It's a contraction (Yeah, yeah, yeah!) What's a contraction? Well, it's the shortening of a word or a group of words By omission of a sound or letter (Woo!) [Pre-Chorus 2] Okay, now here are some notes Syntax you're always mangling (Woo!) No X in \"espresso\" Your participle's danglin' (Uh-huh) But I don't want your drama (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) If you really wanna (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) Leave out that Oxford comma (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)  [Chorus 2] Just keep in mind that \"Be\", \"see\", \"are\", \"you\" Are words, not letters (Woo!) Get it together (Hey, hey) Use your spell checker You should never Write words using numbers (Woo!) (Hey, hey) Unless you're seven (Yeah-ay) Or your name is Prince (Everybody wise up!)  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes (I hate them crimes) You really need a (Woo!) (I hate them crimes) Full-time proofreader (I mean those crimes) You dumb mouth-breather (Woo!) Well, you should hire (I'll hire) Some cunning linguist (Woo!) To help you distinguish What is proper English (Everybody wise up!) [Bridge] One thing I ask of you (Okay) Time to learn your homophones is past due (Woo!) Learn to diagram a sentence, too Always say \"to whom\", don't ever say \"to who\" (Woo!) And listen up when I tell you this I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis (Woo!) You finished second grade, I hope you can tell If you're doing good or doing well (Woo!) You better figure out the difference Irony is not coincidence (Woo!) And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull About what's figurative and what's literal (Woo!) Oh, but just now (Just now), you said (You said) You \"literally\" couldn't get out of bed (Woo!) (What?) That really makes me want to literally Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head  [Pre-Chorus] I read your e-mail (Yeah, yeah) It's quite apparent (Woo!) Your grammar's errant You're incoherent (Woo!) Saw your blog post (Hey, hey) It's really fantastic (Oh, woah) That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!) 'Cause you write like a spastic (Woo!)  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes (Everybody wise up) Your prose is dopey (Woo!) (Hey) Think you should only (Woah, woah) Write in emoji (Woo!) Oh, you're a lost cause (Hey, hey, hey) Go back to preschool (Woo!) Get out of the gene pool (Hey, hey, hey) Try your best to not drool (Woo!)  [Outro] Never mind, I give up (Woo!)

         "[Verse 1] Seven o'clock in the evening Watchin somethin' stupid on TV I'm zoned out on the sofa When my wife comes in the room and sees me She says, \"Is this Behind the Music with Lynyrd Skynyrd?\" And I say, \"I don't know Say, \"It's gettin' late, what you wanna do for dinner?\" She says, \"I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry.\" I said, \"Well, you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either But I could eat.\" She said, \"So what do you have in mind?\" I said, \"I don't know. What about you?\" She said, \"I don't care ... if you're hungry, let's eat.\" I said, \"That's what we're gonna do! But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!\" And she says, \"Let me think... What's left in our refrigerator?\" I said, \"Well, there's tuna, I know.\" She said, \"That went bad a week ago!\" I said, \"Is the chili okay?\" She said, \"You finished that yesterday!\" I hopped up and said \"I don't know; do you want to get something delivered?\" She's like, \"Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!\" I'm like, \"No, I said 'delivered.'\" She's like, \"I heard you say 'liver'!\" I'm like, \"I should know what I said...\" She's like, \"Whatever! I just don't want any liver!\" Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID It was just cousin Larry Callin' for the third time today... My wife said, \"Let it go to voicemail.\" I said, \"Okay.\" \"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right! So what d'ya want to do?\" She said, \"Why don't you whip up somethin' in the kitchen?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, \"why don't you?\" And then she said \"Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes... Oh, here's your keys\" I step a little bit closer Say, \"Okay, where ya want to go?\" She says, \"How about The Ivy?\" I said, \"Yeah, well, I don't know... I don't feel like gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food\" She's says, \"Olive Garden?\" I say, \"Nah, I'm not in the mood... And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt\" She says, \"Just forget about it\" I said, \"No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!\" Then I get an idea I say, \"I know what we'll do!\" She says, \"What?\" I say, \"Guess!\" She says \"What?\" I say, \"We're goin' to the drive-thru!\" So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors And we get in those car doors Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat belts As we pull out the driveway Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru! Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru? [Verse 2] Well, here we are In the drive-thru line, me and her Cars in front of us, cars in back of us All just waiting to order There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the window and scream \"Hey! What you trying to do, blind me?\" My wife says \"Maybe we should park... We could just go eat inside.\" I said, \"I'm wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride...\" Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', \"Can I take your order, please?\" I said, \"Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese.\" Then my wife says \"Baby, hold on—I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time\" I said, \"You always get a cheeseburger!\" She says, \"That's not what I'm hungry for.\" I put my head in my hands and scream \"I don't know who you are anymore!\" The voice on the speaker says \"I don't have all day!\" I said, \"Then take our order And we'll be on our way! I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger, too\" She's like, \"You want onions on that?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I already said that I do... Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it! And two medium root beers No, just one—we'll split it.\" Then I said \"I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright... So read me back my order Let's make sure you got it right.\" She says \"One—you want a chicken sandwich Two—you want a cheeseburger Three—curly fries, and a large root beer\" \"Stop! Don't go no further!\" \"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!\" Then she says \"We're havin' a special I supersized you at no charge.\" \"Oh.\" And that's all I could say, was \"Oh.\" And she says \"Now there is somethin' else That I really think you should know You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more...\" I say \"Great, except we're in the drive-thru... So what would I want that for?\" Then she says \"Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar ... hey, is this Paul? And my wife is all like \"No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?\" She says \"Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him last year And I copied off of him in Geometry\" I said, \"I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe.\" And she says, \"Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed to know!\" And then we both were quiet And things got real intense Then she says \"Next window, please That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents!\" So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I turned on the radio... [Black Dog by Led Zeppelin] Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat there quietly for her sake Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said \"Um I think you have somethin' in your teeth.\" She turned away from me And then turned back and said \"Did I get it?\" I said \"Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it... But hey, ya know, don't sweat it.\" Then she said \"How about now?\" I said \"Yeah, almost There's still a little bit there, but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast.\" Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I can't believe there's no wallet! [Verse 3] And the lady at the window's like \"Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty-two\" I turn around to my wife and say \"How much have you got on you?\" She just rolls her eyes and says \"I'll pay for this, I guess\" So she reaches into her purse And busts out the American Express I hand it to the lady And she says \"Oh, dear It's gotta be cash only We don't take credit cards here\" I took back the card and said \"Gee, really? Well, that sucks\" And that's when I found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks I said, \"I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today\" She says, \"I never got around to it, so where's your wallet anyway?\" And I said, \"Never mind Just help me to find some change...\" Now the lady at the window Is lookin' at me kind of strange... And she says, \"Mister, please We gotta move this line along\" I said, \"Now, hold your stinkin' horses, lady! We won't be long\" So I looked around inside the glove-box And checked the mat beneath my feet I found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up and says \"You're still about a dollar short\" And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, \"You know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!\" And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, \"Okay Forget the chicken sandwich then\" So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man, I just can't wait to eat And now we see this acne-ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that says \"Hello, my name is Eugene\" And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him, \"Hey, Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?\" Well, he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, \"I'm sorry! What did you want again?\" I say \"Ketchup!\" And he says, \"Oh, yeah, that's right... I just spaced out there for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight.\" And then he hands me the ketchup And now we're finally drivin' away And the food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say \"Baby, gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!\" So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger And I pick up the burger And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it They forgot the onions!",

The look on your face will be priceless When you find that forty-pound watermelon in your colon Trade toothbrushes with an albino dwarf Then give a hickey to Meryl Streep  Taurus! You will never find true happiness What you gonna do, cry about it?

Your birthday party will be ruined once again By your explosive flatulence Your love life will run into trouble When your fiance hurls a javelin through your chest  Cancer! The position of Jupiter says that you should spend The rest of the week face down in the mud Try not to shove a roll of duct tape up your nose While taking your driver's test  Leo!

Very, very soon One of them will be all mine Guys with nametags walking down the aisles Rows of garden hoses that go on for miles and miles Brand new socket wrenches in a plethora of styles All arranged alphabetically And they're doing a promotional stunt There's a great big purple sign out front That says every 27th customer Will get a ball peen hammer free  [Chorus] I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when) When are they gonna open up that door?

Eat it! If it's getting cold, reheat it Have a big dinner Have a light snack If you don't like it, you can't send it back Just eat it! Eat it! Get yourself an egg and beat it! Have some more chicken. Have some more pie It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried Just eat it! Eat it! Don't you make me repeat it!",

Then save the bullshit questions Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't Sometimes it's just how the light hits their eyes Do you believe in love?",

Don't be mad at me, it's all that I can be I did not choose for you to lose  Better than best, better than best, I am Better than best, better than best, I've been And it's been a couple seconds since I first learned my lesson That nothing comes from nothing and dancing is the best revenge Better than best, better than best, never been lesser than Better than best, better than best and dancing is the best revenge Revenge Sure, I still get scared, that's why I'm still here Those same old fears are there, like I said, it's a rear view mirror It wasn't always pretty, it wasn't always nice The voices in my head gave good advice  And one day it all has been So don't forget to leave 'em laughin' And if you got no epitaph then Just leave 'em something in Latin Sometimes wish come true But I don't think they will for you You wish that you were that one But that's the nature of one and I'm that one I'm that one  Better than best, better than best, I am Better than best, better than best, I've been And it's been a couple seconds since I first learned my lesson That nothing comes from nothing and dancing is the best revenge Better than best, better than best, never been lesser than Better than best, better than best and dancing is the best revenge Revenge  One day it all has been So don't forget to leave 'em laughin' (Revenge) And if you got no epitaph then Just leave 'em something in Latin",

None of us) (Thank you, Evan Hansen, for giving us a space to remember Connor) Oooooh (Share) Oooooh (Sending prayers from Michigan) Oooooh (Vermont) Oooooh (Tampa) Oooooh (Sacremento) Oooooh (Repost) Oooooh (Thank you, Evan) Oooooh (Share) Oooooh (We won't forget you, Connor) Oooooh (Thanks to Evan Hansen) Oooooh (We'll remember Connor) Oooooh (We’ll always remember) [Chorus] A part of me Needs a way to say goodbye A part of me Now remembers how to cry A part of me Wants to share the hurt and heartache So the world can see That you’ll always be A part of me  [Verse Four] You left this life And left me numb All were blind, and deaf, and dumb We didn't know how bad it had become Or how to save you Now every prayer I’ve learned is prayed And every moment shared replayed I won't allow your memory to fade Can I save you?  [Verse Five] The sky collapsed without a sound As broken pieces hit the ground The rain fell down around me and I drowned But I will save you Our secret sorrows overflowed I see them in your afterglow I promise I will never let you go I will save you [Bridge] You are not alone You are not alone You are not alone You are not alone You are not alone You are not alone You are not alone You are not alone You are not alone  [Chorus] A part of me Can't believe it's even real A part of me Doesn’t know how much to feel A part of me Finds a rush within the pain A part of me Needs the feeling to remain A part of me Wants to share the hurt and heartache So the world can see That you'll always be  [Spoken: EVAN & ZOE] I think there's something you should know You make me feel closer to him  [CONNOR] A part of me",

It's a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more  [Verse 1: Punch] I was taught never trust a nigga, far as you can see him Teach a nigga how to fish, as apposed to try'na feed him Look a man in the eyes, that's the best way to read him Cause faces they change, but point of views remain I got a strange feeling, that I'm a lil bit different Beyond the customs and tradition of a project living My Korean war vet, grandfather's affliction Was stress and I inherited his heart condition And Van Arthur's addiction, was heroin needles Petty hustling, d'evils, that street men lust So I'm mixed with that lethal combination but trust I've only scratched the surface, what's underneath this verse is The feeling of a young boy lost, without a purpose Still waters run deep in the street we were submerged in Police lurking, try'na catch a nigga serving He ain't going back to jail, so he bust a verse [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] This is for my everyday young nigga It don't really matter where you from niggas Before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga Cause you don't know when that day'll come nigga Cause only Lord knows that I know how you feel What we gotta do just to live Is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled  [Verse 2: Punch] It's hard to get to know me, unless you hear between bars Tortured soul self contained on my childhood scars I was involved from a far, affected by the street laws Concrete walls, not even earthquakes could shake them brick walls Nickerson garden projects this is me y'all Where Dope dealers have it all and then freefall Caine numbs the pain up and down the ghetto seesaw The voice of the youth, they hear me and they see y'all They don't see a diamond in the rough, they see flaws They should see how we was raised and they would be in awe Against all it gets hard not to kill niggas It's like a full-time job not to grab the semi-auti And go kamikaze on somebody who plotting Probably on my body laying lifeless, ungodly sacrifices To the streets, this is the trinity Money malice and murder the hood's deity [Hook]  [Verse 3] They say the average black man only lives to 25 Well I made it past that and a nigga still alive Which means I'm in the red, I'm indebted to death That's the wages that sin pay, I'm still tracing my steps Leaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose That grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man My only fear is pops holding moms hand Dripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen By any means avoiding the city traffic Shooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage A young kid turned savage, city madness A picture painted on the street's canvas, excuse my brashness I'm trying to live to see past this Staring at the world and my rear view past tense In no particular fashion, I'm on borrowed time I'mma grind with a passion  [Hook]  [Outro] Generation to generation to come They won't come in mind Sacrifices, sacrifices, sacrifices Deadly circle, deadly circle",

You know that's unheard of I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat And my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare We're just technologically impaired  [Bridge] There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar Not a single luxury Like Robinson Crusoe It's as primitive as can be  [Chorus] We been spending most our lives Living in an Amish paradise We're just plain and simple guys Living in an Amish paradise There's no time for sin and vice Living in an Amish paradise We don't fight, we all play nice Living in an Amish paradise [Verse 3] Hitchin' up the buggy, churning lots of butter Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart? Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife So don't be vain and don't be whiny Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie  [Chorus] We been spending most our lives Living in an Amish paradise We're all crazy Mennonites Living in an Amish paradise There's no cops and traffic lights Living in an Amish paradise But you'd probably think it bites Living in an Amish paradise  [Outro] (Ooh, ooh, yech!)",

If you don't know how to conjugate (Woo!) Hey, maybe you flunked that class (Hey, hey, hey) And maybe now you find (Hey, hey, hey) That people mock you online (Hey, hey, hey) (Everybody wise up!)  [Verse 2] Okay, now here's the deal I'll try to educate ya (Woo!) (Ow!) Gonna familiarize You with the nomenclature (Woo!) (Meow!) You'll learn the definitions (Hey, hey, hey) Of nouns and prepositions (Hey, hey, hey) Literacy's your mission (Hey, hey, hey) [Pre-Chorus] And that's why I think it's a good time (Woo!) To learn some grammar (What) Now, did I stammer? Work on that grammar (Woo!) You should know when It's \"less\" or it's \"fewer\" (Woo!) (Oh, yeah) Like people who were (All right) Never raised in a sewer  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes Like \"I could care less\" (Hey, hey, hey) That means you do care (Whoa) At least a little Don't be a moron (Hey, hey) You'd better slow down And use the right pronoun (Hey, hey) Show the world you're no clown (Everybody wise up!)  [Verse 2] Say you've got an \"i-t\" Followed by apostrophe \"s\" (Woo!) Now, what does that mean? You would not use \"it's\" in this case (Woo!) As a possessive (No, no, no!) It's a contraction (Yeah, yeah, yeah!) What's a contraction? Well, it's the shortening of a word or a group of words By omission of a sound or letter (Woo!) [Pre-Chorus 2] Okay, now here are some notes Syntax you're always mangling (Woo!) No X in \"espresso\" Your participle's danglin' (Uh-huh) But I don't want your drama (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) If you really wanna (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) Leave out that Oxford comma (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)  [Chorus 2] Just keep in mind that \"Be\", \"see\", \"are\", \"you\" Are words, not letters (Woo!) Get it together (Hey, hey) Use your spell checker You should never Write words using numbers (Woo!) (Hey, hey) Unless you're seven (Yeah-ay) Or your name is Prince (Everybody wise up!)  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes (I hate them crimes) You really need a (Woo!) (I hate them crimes) Full-time proofreader (I mean those crimes) You dumb mouth-breather (Woo!) Well, you should hire (I'll hire) Some cunning linguist (Woo!) To help you distinguish What is proper English (Everybody wise up!) [Bridge] One thing I ask of you (Okay) Time to learn your homophones is past due (Woo!) Learn to diagram a sentence, too Always say \"to whom\", don't ever say \"to who\" (Woo!) And listen up when I tell you this I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis (Woo!) You finished second grade, I hope you can tell If you're doing good or doing well (Woo!) You better figure out the difference Irony is not coincidence (Woo!) And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull About what's figurative and what's literal (Woo!) Oh, but just now (Just now), you said (You said) You \"literally\" couldn't get out of bed (Woo!) (What?) That really makes me want to literally Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head  [Pre-Chorus] I read your e-mail (Yeah, yeah) It's quite apparent (Woo!) Your grammar's errant You're incoherent (Woo!) Saw your blog post (Hey, hey) It's really fantastic (Oh, woah) That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!) 'Cause you write like a spastic (Woo!)  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes (Everybody wise up) Your prose is dopey (Woo!) (Hey) Think you should only (Woah, woah) Write in emoji (Woo!) Oh, you're a lost cause (Hey, hey, hey) Go back to preschool (Woo!) Get out of the gene pool (Hey, hey, hey) Try your best to not drool (Woo!)  [Outro] Never mind, I give up (Woo!)

I do HTML for 'em all Even made a homepage for my dog, yo I got myself a fanny pack They were havin' a sale down at The Gap Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap Pop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin' freaky I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream I was in AV Club and Glee Club and even the Chess Team Only question I ever thought was hard Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard? Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair Got my name on my underwear [Chorus] They see me strollin', they laughin' And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy Just because I'm white and nerdy Just because I'm white and nerdy All because I'm white and nerdy Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!

         "[Verse 1] Seven o'clock in the evening Watchin somethin' stupid on TV I'm zoned out on the sofa When my wife comes in the room and sees me She says, \"Is this Behind the Music with Lynyrd Skynyrd?\" And I say, \"I don't know Say, \"It's gettin' late, what you wanna do for dinner?\" She says, \"I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry.\" I said, \"Well, you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either But I could eat.\" She said, \"So what do you have in mind?\" I said, \"I don't know. What about you?\" She said, \"I don't care ... if you're hungry, let's eat.\" I said, \"That's what we're gonna do! But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!\" And she says, \"Let me think... What's left in our refrigerator?\" I said, \"Well, there's tuna, I know.\" She said, \"That went bad a week ago!\" I said, \"Is the chili okay?\" She said, \"You finished that yesterday!\" I hopped up and said \"I don't know; do you want to get something delivered?\" She's like, \"Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!\" I'm like, \"No, I said 'delivered.'\" She's like, \"I heard you say 'liver'!\" I'm like, \"I should know what I said...\" She's like, \"Whatever! I just don't want any liver!\" Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID It was just cousin Larry Callin' for the third time today... My wife said, \"Let it go to voicemail.\" I said, \"Okay.\" \"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right! So what d'ya want to do?\" She said, \"Why don't you whip up somethin' in the kitchen?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, \"why don't you?\" And then she said \"Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes... Oh, here's your keys\" I step a little bit closer Say, \"Okay, where ya want to go?\" She says, \"How about The Ivy?\" I said, \"Yeah, well, I don't know... I don't feel like gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food\" She's says, \"Olive Garden?\" I say, \"Nah, I'm not in the mood... And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt\" She says, \"Just forget about it\" I said, \"No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!\" Then I get an idea I say, \"I know what we'll do!\" She says, \"What?\" I say, \"Guess!\" She says \"What?\" I say, \"We're goin' to the drive-thru!\" So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors And we get in those car doors Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat belts As we pull out the driveway Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru! Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru? [Verse 2] Well, here we are In the drive-thru line, me and her Cars in front of us, cars in back of us All just waiting to order There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the window and scream \"Hey! What you trying to do, blind me?\" My wife says \"Maybe we should park... We could just go eat inside.\" I said, \"I'm wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride...\" Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', \"Can I take your order, please?\" I said, \"Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese.\" Then my wife says \"Baby, hold on—I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time\" I said, \"You always get a cheeseburger!\" She says, \"That's not what I'm hungry for.\" I put my head in my hands and scream \"I don't know who you are anymore!\" The voice on the speaker says \"I don't have all day!\" I said, \"Then take our order And we'll be on our way! I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger, too\" She's like, \"You want onions on that?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I already said that I do... Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it! And two medium root beers No, just one—we'll split it.\" Then I said \"I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright... So read me back my order Let's make sure you got it right.\" She says \"One—you want a chicken sandwich Two—you want a cheeseburger Three—curly fries, and a large root beer\" \"Stop! Don't go no further!\" \"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!\" Then she says \"We're havin' a special I supersized you at no charge.\" \"Oh.\" And that's all I could say, was \"Oh.\" And she says \"Now there is somethin' else That I really think you should know You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more...\" I say \"Great, except we're in the drive-thru... So what would I want that for?\" Then she says \"Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar ... hey, is this Paul? And my wife is all like \"No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?\" She says \"Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him last year And I copied off of him in Geometry\" I said, \"I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe.\" And she says, \"Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed to know!\" And then we both were quiet And things got real intense Then she says \"Next window, please That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents!\" So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I turned on the radio... [Black Dog by Led Zeppelin] Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat there quietly for her sake Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said \"Um I think you have somethin' in your teeth.\" She turned away from me And then turned back and said \"Did I get it?\" I said \"Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it... But hey, ya know, don't sweat it.\" Then she said \"How about now?\" I said \"Yeah, almost There's still a little bit there, but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast.\" Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I can't believe there's no wallet! [Verse 3] And the lady at the window's like \"Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty-two\" I turn around to my wife and say \"How much have you got on you?\" She just rolls her eyes and says \"I'll pay for this, I guess\" So she reaches into her purse And busts out the American Express I hand it to the lady And she says \"Oh, dear It's gotta be cash only We don't take credit cards here\" I took back the card and said \"Gee, really? Well, that sucks\" And that's when I found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks I said, \"I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today\" She says, \"I never got around to it, so where's your wallet anyway?\" And I said, \"Never mind Just help me to find some change...\" Now the lady at the window Is lookin' at me kind of strange... And she says, \"Mister, please We gotta move this line along\" I said, \"Now, hold your stinkin' horses, lady! We won't be long\" So I looked around inside the glove-box And checked the mat beneath my feet I found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up and says \"You're still about a dollar short\" And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, \"You know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!\" And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, \"Okay Forget the chicken sandwich then\" So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man, I just can't wait to eat And now we see this acne-ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that says \"Hello, my name is Eugene\" And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him, \"Hey, Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?\" Well, he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, \"I'm sorry! What did you want again?\" I say \"Ketchup!\" And he says, \"Oh, yeah, that's right... I just spaced out there for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight.\" And then he hands me the ketchup And now we're finally drivin' away And the food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say \"Baby, gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!\" So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger And I pick up the burger And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it They forgot the onions!",

Then save the bullshit questions Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't Sometimes it's just how the light hits their eyes Do you believe in love?",

It's a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more  [Verse 1: Punch] I was taught never trust a nigga, far as you can see him Teach a nigga how to fish, as apposed to try'na feed him Look a man in the eyes, that's the best way to read him Cause faces they change, but point of views remain I got a strange feeling, that I'm a lil bit different Beyond the customs and tradition of a project living My Korean war vet, grandfather's affliction Was stress and I inherited his heart condition And Van Arthur's addiction, was heroin needles Petty hustling, d'evils, that street men lust So I'm mixed with that lethal combination but trust I've only scratched the surface, what's underneath this verse is The feeling of a young boy lost, without a purpose Still waters run deep in the street we were submerged in Police lurking, try'na catch a nigga serving He ain't going back to jail, so he bust a verse [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] This is for my everyday young nigga It don't really matter where you from niggas Before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga Cause you don't know when that day'll come nigga Cause only Lord knows that I know how you feel What we gotta do just to live Is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled  [Verse 2: Punch] It's hard to get to know me, unless you hear between bars Tortured soul self contained on my childhood scars I was involved from a far, affected by the street laws Concrete walls, not even earthquakes could shake them brick walls Nickerson garden projects this is me y'all Where Dope dealers have it all and then freefall Caine numbs the pain up and down the ghetto seesaw The voice of the youth, they hear me and they see y'all They don't see a diamond in the rough, they see flaws They should see how we was raised and they would be in awe Against all it gets hard not to kill niggas It's like a full-time job not to grab the semi-auti And go kamikaze on somebody who plotting Probably on my body laying lifeless, ungodly sacrifices To the streets, this is the trinity Money malice and murder the hood's deity [Hook]  [Verse 3] They say the average black man only lives to 25 Well I made it past that and a nigga still alive Which means I'm in the red, I'm indebted to death That's the wages that sin pay, I'm still tracing my steps Leaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose That grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man My only fear is pops holding moms hand Dripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen By any means avoiding the city traffic Shooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage A young kid turned savage, city madness A picture painted on the street's canvas, excuse my brashness I'm trying to live to see past this Staring at the world and my rear view past tense In no particular fashion, I'm on borrowed time I'mma grind with a passion  [Hook]  [Outro] Generation to generation to come They won't come in mind Sacrifices, sacrifices, sacrifices Deadly circle, deadly circle",

You know that's unheard of I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat And my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare We're just technologically impaired  [Bridge] There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar Not a single luxury Like Robinson Crusoe It's as primitive as can be  [Chorus] We been spending most our lives Living in an Amish paradise We're just plain and simple guys Living in an Amish paradise There's no time for sin and vice Living in an Amish paradise We don't fight, we all play nice Living in an Amish paradise [Verse 3] Hitchin' up the buggy, churning lots of butter Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart? Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife So don't be vain and don't be whiny Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie  [Chorus] We been spending most our lives Living in an Amish paradise We're all crazy Mennonites Living in an Amish paradise There's no cops and traffic lights Living in an Amish paradise But you'd probably think it bites Living in an Amish paradise  [Outro] (Ooh, ooh, yech!)",

If you don't know how to conjugate (Woo!) Hey, maybe you flunked that class (Hey, hey, hey) And maybe now you find (Hey, hey, hey) That people mock you online (Hey, hey, hey) (Everybody wise up!)  [Verse 2] Okay, now here's the deal I'll try to educate ya (Woo!) (Ow!) Gonna familiarize You with the nomenclature (Woo!) (Meow!) You'll learn the definitions (Hey, hey, hey) Of nouns and prepositions (Hey, hey, hey) Literacy's your mission (Hey, hey, hey) [Pre-Chorus] And that's why I think it's a good time (Woo!) To learn some grammar (What) Now, did I stammer? Work on that grammar (Woo!) You should know when It's \"less\" or it's \"fewer\" (Woo!) (Oh, yeah) Like people who were (All right) Never raised in a sewer  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes Like \"I could care less\" (Hey, hey, hey) That means you do care (Whoa) At least a little Don't be a moron (Hey, hey) You'd better slow down And use the right pronoun (Hey, hey) Show the world you're no clown (Everybody wise up!)  [Verse 2] Say you've got an \"i-t\" Followed by apostrophe \"s\" (Woo!) Now, what does that mean? You would not use \"it's\" in this case (Woo!) As a possessive (No, no, no!) It's a contraction (Yeah, yeah, yeah!) What's a contraction? Well, it's the shortening of a word or a group of words By omission of a sound or letter (Woo!) [Pre-Chorus 2] Okay, now here are some notes Syntax you're always mangling (Woo!) No X in \"espresso\" Your participle's danglin' (Uh-huh) But I don't want your drama (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) If you really wanna (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) Leave out that Oxford comma (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)  [Chorus 2] Just keep in mind that \"Be\", \"see\", \"are\", \"you\" Are words, not letters (Woo!) Get it together (Hey, hey) Use your spell checker You should never Write words using numbers (Woo!) (Hey, hey) Unless you're seven (Yeah-ay) Or your name is Prince (Everybody wise up!)  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes (I hate them crimes) You really need a (Woo!) (I hate them crimes) Full-time proofreader (I mean those crimes) You dumb mouth-breather (Woo!) Well, you should hire (I'll hire) Some cunning linguist (Woo!) To help you distinguish What is proper English (Everybody wise up!) [Bridge] One thing I ask of you (Okay) Time to learn your homophones is past due (Woo!) Learn to diagram a sentence, too Always say \"to whom\", don't ever say \"to who\" (Woo!) And listen up when I tell you this I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis (Woo!) You finished second grade, I hope you can tell If you're doing good or doing well (Woo!) You better figure out the difference Irony is not coincidence (Woo!) And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull About what's figurative and what's literal (Woo!) Oh, but just now (Just now), you said (You said) You \"literally\" couldn't get out of bed (Woo!) (What?) That really makes me want to literally Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head  [Pre-Chorus] I read your e-mail (Yeah, yeah) It's quite apparent (Woo!) Your grammar's errant You're incoherent (Woo!) Saw your blog post (Hey, hey) It's really fantastic (Oh, woah) That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!) 'Cause you write like a spastic (Woo!)  [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes (Everybody wise up) Your prose is dopey (Woo!) (Hey) Think you should only (Woah, woah) Write in emoji (Woo!) Oh, you're a lost cause (Hey, hey, hey) Go back to preschool (Woo!) Get out of the gene pool (Hey, hey, hey) Try your best to not drool (Woo!)  [Outro] Never mind, I give up (Woo!)

Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair Got my name on my underwear [Chorus] They see me strollin', they laughin' And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy Just because I'm white and nerdy Just because I'm white and nerdy All because I'm white and nerdy Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!

         "[Verse 1] Seven o'clock in the evening Watchin somethin' stupid on TV I'm zoned out on the sofa When my wife comes in the room and sees me She says, \"Is this Behind the Music with Lynyrd Skynyrd?\" And I say, \"I don't know Say, \"It's gettin' late, what you wanna do for dinner?\" She says, \"I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry.\" I said, \"Well, you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either But I could eat.\" She said, \"So what do you have in mind?\" I said, \"I don't know. What about you?\" She said, \"I don't care ... if you're hungry, let's eat.\" I said, \"That's what we're gonna do! But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!\" And she says, \"Let me think... What's left in our refrigerator?\" I said, \"Well, there's tuna, I know.\" She said, \"That went bad a week ago!\" I said, \"Is the chili okay?\" She said, \"You finished that yesterday!\" I hopped up and said \"I don't know; do you want to get something delivered?\" She's like, \"Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!\" I'm like, \"No, I said 'delivered.'\" She's like, \"I heard you say 'liver'!\" I'm like, \"I should know what I said...\" She's like, \"Whatever! I just don't want any liver!\" Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID It was just cousin Larry Callin' for the third time today... My wife said, \"Let it go to voicemail.\" I said, \"Okay.\" \"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right! So what d'ya want to do?\" She said, \"Why don't you whip up somethin' in the kitchen?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, \"why don't you?\" And then she said \"Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes... Oh, here's your keys\" I step a little bit closer Say, \"Okay, where ya want to go?\" She says, \"How about The Ivy?\" I said, \"Yeah, well, I don't know... I don't feel like gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food\" She's says, \"Olive Garden?\" I say, \"Nah, I'm not in the mood... And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt\" She says, \"Just forget about it\" I said, \"No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!\" Then I get an idea I say, \"I know what we'll do!\" She says, \"What?\" I say, \"Guess!\" She says \"What?\" I say, \"We're goin' to the drive-thru!\" So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors And we get in those car doors Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat belts As we pull out the driveway Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru! Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru? [Verse 2] Well, here we are In the drive-thru line, me and her Cars in front of us, cars in back of us All just waiting to order There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the window and scream \"Hey! What you trying to do, blind me?\" My wife says \"Maybe we should park... We could just go eat inside.\" I said, \"I'm wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride...\" Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', \"Can I take your order, please?\" I said, \"Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese.\" Then my wife says \"Baby, hold on—I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time\" I said, \"You always get a cheeseburger!\" She says, \"That's not what I'm hungry for.\" I put my head in my hands and scream \"I don't know who you are anymore!\" The voice on the speaker says \"I don't have all day!\" I said, \"Then take our order And we'll be on our way! I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger, too\" She's like, \"You want onions on that?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I already said that I do... Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it! And two medium root beers No, just one—we'll split it.\" Then I said \"I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright... So read me back my order Let's make sure you got it right.\" She says \"One—you want a chicken sandwich Two—you want a cheeseburger Three—curly fries, and a large root beer\" \"Stop! Don't go no further!\" \"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!\" Then she says \"We're havin' a special I supersized you at no charge.\" \"Oh.\" And that's all I could say, was \"Oh.\" And she says \"Now there is somethin' else That I really think you should know You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more...\" I say \"Great, except we're in the drive-thru... So what would I want that for?\" Then she says \"Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar ... hey, is this Paul? And my wife is all like \"No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?\" She says \"Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him last year And I copied off of him in Geometry\" I said, \"I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe.\" And she says, \"Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed to know!\" And then we both were quiet And things got real intense Then she says \"Next window, please That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents!\" So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I turned on the radio... [Black Dog by Led Zeppelin] Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat there quietly for her sake Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said \"Um I think you have somethin' in your teeth.\" She turned away from me And then turned back and said \"Did I get it?\" I said \"Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it... But hey, ya know, don't sweat it.\" Then she said \"How about now?\" I said \"Yeah, almost There's still a little bit there, but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast.\" Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I can't believe there's no wallet! [Verse 3] And the lady at the window's like \"Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty-two\" I turn around to my wife and say \"How much have you got on you?\" She just rolls her eyes and says \"I'll pay for this, I guess\" So she reaches into her purse And busts out the American Express I hand it to the lady And she says \"Oh, dear It's gotta be cash only We don't take credit cards here\" I took back the card and said \"Gee, really? Well, that sucks\" And that's when I found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks I said, \"I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today\" She says, \"I never got around to it, so where's your wallet anyway?\" And I said, \"Never mind Just help me to find some change...\" Now the lady at the window Is lookin' at me kind of strange... And she says, \"Mister, please We gotta move this line along\" I said, \"Now, hold your stinkin' horses, lady! We won't be long\" So I looked around inside the glove-box And checked the mat beneath my feet I found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up and says \"You're still about a dollar short\" And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, \"You know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!\" And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, \"Okay Forget the chicken sandwich then\" So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man, I just can't wait to eat And now we see this acne-ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that says \"Hello, my name is Eugene\" And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him, \"Hey, Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?\" Well, he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, \"I'm sorry! What did you want again?\" I say \"Ketchup!\" And he says, \"Oh, yeah, that's right... I just spaced out there for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight.\" And then he hands me the ketchup And now we're finally drivin' away And the food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say \"Baby, gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!\" So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger And I pick up the burger And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it They forgot the onions!",

Thenardier I forget where we met Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge Where the duke did that puke Down the Duchess's de-coll-etage? Marius No, 'Baron de Thenard' The circles I move in are humbler by far. Go away, Thenardier! Do you think I don't know who you are? Mme. Thenardier He's not fooled, told you so. Show M'sieur what you've come here to show. Tell the boy what you know! [Applause from the dancers as the waltz finishes.] Marius When I look at you, I remember Eponine She was more than you deserved, who gave her birth But now she is with God and happier, I hope Than here on earth!

Thenardier You've got cash and a heart You could give us a bit of a start We can prove, plain as ink Your bride's father is not what you think. Thenardier There's a tale I could tell Mme. Thenardier Information we're willing to sell. Thenardier There's a man that he slew I saw the corpse clear as I'm seeing you! What I tell you is true! Mme. Thenardier Pity to disturb you at a feast like this But five hundred francs surely wouldn't come amiss. Marius In God's name say what you have to say. Thenardier But first you pay! What I saw, clear as light Jean Valjean in the sewers that night Had this corpse on his back Hanging there like a great bloody sack. I was there, never fear Even found me this fine souvenir! [Thenardier shows Marius a ring.] Marius I know this! This was mine! Surely this is some heavenly sign! Thenardier One more thing, mark this well It was the night the barricades fell. Marius Then it's true, then I'm right Jean Valjean was my savior that night! [Marius hits Thenardier and then throws money at him.] As for you, take this too! God forgive the things that we do.

If you don't know how to conjugate (Woo!) Hey, maybe you flunked that class (Hey, hey, hey) And maybe now you find (Hey, hey, hey) That people mock you online (Hey, hey, hey) (Everybody wise up!) [Verse 2] Okay, now here's the deal I'll try to educate ya (Woo!) (Ow!) Gonna familiarize You with the nomenclature (Woo!) (Meow!) You'll learn the definitions (Hey, hey, hey) Of nouns and prepositions (Hey, hey, hey) Literacy's your mission (Hey, hey, hey) [Pre-Chorus] And that's why I think it's a good time (Woo!) To learn some grammar (What) Now, did I stammer? Work on that grammar (Woo!) You should know when It's \"less\" or it's \"fewer\" (Woo!) (Oh, yeah) Like people who were (All right) Never raised in a sewer [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes Like \"I could care less\" (Hey, hey, hey) That means you do care (Whoa) At least a little Don't be a moron (Hey, hey) You'd better slow down And use the right pronoun (Hey, hey) Show the world you're no clown (Everybody wise up!) [Verse 2] Say you've got an \"i-t\" Followed by apostrophe \"s\" (Woo!) Now, what does that mean? You would not use \"it's\" in this case (Woo!) As a possessive (No, no, no!) It's a contraction (Yeah, yeah, yeah!) What's a contraction? Well, it's the shortening of a word or a group of words By omission of a sound or letter (Woo!) [Pre-Chorus 2] Okay, now here are some notes Syntax you're always mangling (Woo!) No X in \"espresso\" Your participle's danglin' (Uh-huh) But I don't want your drama (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) If you really wanna (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) Leave out that Oxford comma (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh) [Chorus 2] Just keep in mind that \"Be\", \"see\", \"are\", \"you\" Are words, not letters (Woo!) Get it together (Hey, hey) Use your spell checker You should never Write words using numbers (Woo!) (Hey, hey) Unless you're seven (Yeah-ay) Or your name is Prince (Everybody wise up!) [Chorus 1] I hate these word crimes (I hate them crimes) You really need a (Woo!) (I hate them crimes) Full-time proofreader (I mean those crimes) You dumb mouth-breather (Woo!) Well, you should hire (I'll hire) Some cunning linguist (Woo!) To help you distinguish What is proper English (Everybody wise up!) [Bridge] One thing I ask of you (Okay) Time to learn your homophones is past due (Woo!) Learn to diagram a sentence, too Always say \"to whom\", don't ever say \"to who\" (Woo!) And listen up when I tell you this I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis (Woo!) You finished second grade, I hope you can tell If you're doing good or doing well (Woo!) You better figure out the difference Irony is not coincidence (Woo!) And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull About what's figurative and what's literal (Woo!) Oh, but just now (Just now), you said (You said) You \"literally\" couldn't get out of bed (Woo!) (What?) That really makes me want to literally Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head [Pre-Chorus] I read your e-mail (Yeah, yeah) It's quite apparent (Woo!) Your grammar's errant You're incoherent (Woo!) Saw your blog post (Hey, hey) It's really fantastic (Oh, woah) That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!) 'Cause you write like a spastic (Woo!)

But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!\" And she says, \"Let me think... What's left in our refrigerator?\" I said, \"Well, there's tuna, I know.\" She said, \"That went bad a week ago!\" I said, \"Is the chili okay?\" She said, \"You finished that yesterday!\" I hopped up and said \"I don't know; do you want to get something delivered?\" She's like, \"Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!\" I'm like, \"No, I said 'delivered.'\" She's like, \"I heard you say 'liver'!\" I'm like, \"I should know what I said...\" She's like, \"Whatever! I just don't want any liver!\" Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID It was just cousin Larry Callin' for the third time today... My wife said, \"Let it go to voicemail.\" I said, \"Okay.\" \"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right! So what d'ya want to do?\" She said, \"Why don't you whip up somethin' in the kitchen?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, \"why don't you?\" And then she said \"Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes...

I don't feel like gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food\" She's says, \"Olive Garden?\" I say, \"Nah, I'm not in the mood... And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt\" She says, \"Just forget about it\" I said, \"No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!\" Then I get an idea I say, \"I know what we'll do!\" She says, \"What?\" I say, \"Guess!\" She says \"What?\" I say, \"We're goin' to the drive-thru!\" So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors And we get in those car doors Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat belts As we pull out the driveway Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru! Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru?

What you trying to do, blind me?\" My wife says \"Maybe we should park... We could just go eat inside.\" I said, \"I'm wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride...\" Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', \"Can I take your order, please?\" I said, \"Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese.\" Then my wife says \"Baby, hold on—I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time\" I said, \"You always get a cheeseburger!\" She says, \"That's not what I'm hungry for.\" I put my head in my hands and scream \"I don't know who you are anymore!\" The voice on the speaker says \"I don't have all day!\" I said, \"Then take our order And we'll be on our way! I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger, too\" She's like, \"You want onions on that?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I already said that I do... Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it! And two medium root beers No, just one—we'll split it.\" Then I said \"I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright... So read me back my order Let's make sure you got it right.\" She says \"One—you want a chicken sandwich Two—you want a cheeseburger Three—curly fries, and a large root beer\" \"Stop! Don't go no further!\" \"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!\" Then she says \"We're havin' a special I supersized you at no charge.\" \"Oh.\" And that's all I could say, was \"Oh.\" And she says \"Now there is somethin' else That I really think you should know You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more...\" I say \"Great, except we're in the drive-thru... So what would I want that for?\" Then she says \"Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar ... hey, is this Paul? And my wife is all like \"No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?\" She says \"Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him last year And I copied off of him in Geometry\" I said, \"I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe.\" And she says, \"Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed to know!\" And then we both were quiet And things got real intense Then she says \"Next window, please That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents!\" So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I turned on the radio... [Black Dog by Led Zeppelin] Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat there quietly for her sake Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said \"Um I think you have somethin' in your teeth.\" She turned away from me And then turned back and said \"Did I get it?\" I said \"Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it... But hey, ya know, don't sweat it.\" Then she said \"How about now?\" I said \"Yeah, almost There's still a little bit there, but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast.\" Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I can't believe there's no wallet! [Verse 3] And the lady at the window's like \"Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty-two\" I turn around to my wife and say \"How much have you got on you?\" She just rolls her eyes and says \"I'll pay for this, I guess\" So she reaches into her purse And busts out the American Express I hand it to the lady And she says \"Oh, dear It's gotta be cash only We don't take credit cards here\" I took back the card and said \"Gee, really? Well, that sucks\" And that's when I found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks I said, \"I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today\" She says, \"I never got around to it, so where's your wallet anyway?\" And I said, \"Never mind Just help me to find some change...\" Now the lady at the window Is lookin' at me kind of strange... And she says, \"Mister, please We gotta move this line along\" I said, \"Now, hold your stinkin' horses, lady! We won't be long\" So I looked around inside the glove-box And checked the mat beneath my feet I found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up and says \"You're still about a dollar short\" And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, \"You know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!\" And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, \"Okay Forget the chicken sandwich then\" So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man, I just can't wait to eat And now we see this acne-ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that says \"Hello, my name is Eugene\" And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him, \"Hey, Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?\" Well, he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, \"I'm sorry! What did you want again?\" I say \"Ketchup!\" And he says, \"Oh, yeah, that's right... I just spaced out there for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight.\" And then he hands me the ketchup And now we're finally drivin' away And the food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say \"Baby, gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!\" So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger And I pick up the burger And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it They forgot the onions!",

No hurry on this South American dictator I'll assassinate him later That's when he walked right in my laser sights And my silencer was on And my silencer was on And another target's gone! [Pre-Chorus 2] Yeah, we've got our black ops all over the world From Kazakhstan to Bombay Payin' the bribes like yeah Pluggin' the leaks like yeah; Interrogating the scum of the earth We'll break them by the break of day! [Chorus] Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA! Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA! [Bridge] Need a country destabilized? Look no further, we're your guys! We've got snazzy suits and ties And a better dental plan than the FBI's! [Pre-Chorus 3] Better put your hands up and get in the van Or else you'll get blown away! Stagin' a coup like yeah Brainwashin' moles like yeah We only torture the folks we don't like You're probably gonna be okay! [Chorus] Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA! Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA!",
