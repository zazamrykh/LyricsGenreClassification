Shit, I bet Patch could fix the glitches\nNo one thought that he would win outside the dudes core base\nAnd thats Goldilocks breakfast - a few cornflakes with a lukewarm take\nSo tell Michigan J.

Never been great\nBut you let Pigsty take all the heat for saying the shit you shouldve said in his place!\nCause Vancouver always came last when they were checkin for names\nTheyll book any URL artist before they get you a plate!\nSo you cowered away when those questions were raised\nThe same dude questionin religion just accepted his fate?\nAnd its sad, cause youre the one that they respect and they praise!\nAnd you never spoke up for your people\nKing Whisper - now I get it!\nThats a hell of a name!\nBut that loyalty paid off, right? I mean, hardly, dawg\nWe booked this for VanCity, the card gets dropped\nAnd it gets less staff promo than Charron freestyling in a parking lot!?!\nSo I hope you wrote your little heart out, and I hope that you win\nAnd maybe if you go viral, itll be like the debts paid\nAnd youll get the chance to pay your own flight to Toronto and open up Decade!\nGood luck!\n\n[Round 3: Illipsis]\nI said...that was real dope\nSome more shit that wont happen\nIs if Krome rappin, Krome strappin wit a chrome Magnum\nKromes only line is in his jeans\nFuck is Krome packin?\nCan probably bet its no matic (nomadic) like a Cro-Magnon!\nBOW!

Shit, I bet Patch could fix the glitches\nNo one thought that he would win outside the dudes core base\nAnd thats Goldilocks breakfast - a few cornflakes with a lukewarm take\nSo tell Michigan J.

Never been great\nBut you let Pigsty take all the heat for saying the shit you shouldve said in his place!\nCause Vancouver always came last when they were checkin for names\nTheyll book any URL artist before they get you a plate!\nSo you cowered away when those questions were raised\nThe same dude questionin religion just accepted his fate?\nAnd its sad, cause youre the one that they respect and they praise!\nAnd you never spoke up for your people\nKing Whisper - now I get it!\nThats a hell of a name!\nBut that loyalty paid off, right? I mean, hardly, dawg\nWe booked this for VanCity, the card gets dropped\nAnd it gets less staff promo than Charron freestyling in a parking lot!?!\nSo I hope you wrote your little heart out, and I hope that you win\nAnd maybe if you go viral, itll be like the debts paid\nAnd youll get the chance to pay your own flight to Toronto and open up Decade!\nGood luck!\n\n[Round 3: Illipsis]\nI said...that was real dope\nSome more shit that wont happen\nIs if Krome rappin, Krome strappin wit a chrome Magnum\nKromes only line is in his jeans\nFuck is Krome packin?\nCan probably bet its no matic (nomadic) like a Cro-Magnon!\nBOW!

Blood moon on the rise, he see the waxing crescent Inferno, the flames illuminate the path hes treaded You can hear the damned lamenting Past regrets when they cant clasp redemption You cant fathom the depths But you can hazard a guess where Max is headin Flashback to how this match incepted Talkback wanna broadcast how rad his pen is Like mines not the one they used to clash with legends! Like mines not the one they had to match the best with! Like mines- Man, forget it But you know its a trap they settin, right? Shit, its a valid question! Ive seen your accolades, and thats when I got apprehensive of the fan perspective Shit, yall only gassed this cretin Since on online forums, hes such a nagging presence A constant whining drone that needs to have attention Outside of that connection Max is just a grasping beg that has to ask for credit like a tax exemption! I bet he claim he handled Jaws like they were at the dentist And this an apt progression? Nah, its chiropractic method! Ill snap his back in seconds, so he can stand corrected! When this was the match suggested, pussy, I was apathetic! Off how we write alone (a loan), I got no interest in principle (principal) Its a bad investment! Lets keep it kosher! You whined (Jew wine) for this pairing like a Manischewitz So Im washin the tool, tryin to make the cut: pass the antiseptic Just give him the large picture: panoramic lenses You are dying just to die, while I lacked incentive This aint even a battle, its a practice session And youre an A.I. bot on the lowest challenge setting! Fight back! Shit, I dont even have to press him I just want it called early like a snap election He tryin to draft amendments to enact protection They gave me a bill to kill: this wont get past the Senate! His writings the same on every card, a standard run-of-the-mill Damn, these rats relentless! My bad, thats a Magic reference - you dont have to get it! A simple favor could send him up in the air: Anna Kendrick Cause I make an acid bath when I get handed lemons Youre French? Well, this verse, I brought a chopper to the palace exit Maxime! Yas, queen, you gettin Antoinetted! Thats beheaded So France is gettin cut, this storys Anglo-centric Or a fade knock his soul out the astral spectrum! Put a bottle to your waves like a stranded message! How I fight in the Cage? Dirty: Bad Lieutenant! Youre a placid, pleasant, standard template That cant mask inspection of when he act aggressive No, a hackish yes-man with a lack of ethics That dick-suck for a quick buck and fan consensus No! A bland, synthetic, trash, generic, average, precious, angry peasant Arrival correlates exactly when the brand descended Cause if hes what you push as talent, then its sad and desperate! You are bottom-of-the-barrel, fucking rancid remnants Fucking leech on this league that has latched and bled it And thats why Krome and Champ contention is such a hackneyed premise Ill leave him hanging from the chain like he can have the necklace This shits a mirror-match? Im leavin with a cracked reflection, and a scattered semblance in the glass Ive stepped in You are dog shit, I am cosmic: thats expensive One round, and I aint even have to mention how trash Quebec is Lets go [Round 2: Krome] Man, I already have a headache Yo, look, that little growling sound you make when you rap is the most cringe-worthy shit Ive ever heard in my life! You need to scratch that noise Your punchlines dont sound better when you spit them in the Batman voice! And tonight, I dont wanna hear any type of aggression Cause being a pussy made you bipolar in half of a second Remember when you dissed Manik and bitched up when he was askin you questions? You hated, and then liked him in the span of a sentence All it took was for Manik to press him to cause manic depression! He rolled up on you, you seemed panicked for help Smart enough to know that native smoke would be bad for your health You fidgety faggot! Who the fuck told you to rap!? The closest you been to being an Alpha was joining a frat! And I aint come to play nice with this weirdo! Im here to bark on him, since nobodys bothered These bullets comin out they shell in the crowd But you goin out solo, since you socially awkward! The shit that you spit put us to sleep And that aint helpin your scene generate more profit Yeah, we cut from a different cloth, and yours got chloroform on it! So go ahead, spit your played-out lies You need an ounce of personality to break down mine Glock party For the down payment, we droppin a body Riskin life to take yours like a kamikaze Clout-chasin, sendin shots to make the news: no paparazzi Or gun-butt to try dentin (trident in) his grill like Maseratis I give a fuck about Illipsis I showed up on my pimp shit The watch called Arthritis: I got a sick wrist Skeleton face on it like the Misfits The hands touchin gold like Midas You rock a Fitbit, nitwit! Man, I swear to God this shit is a joke Youre just the man out West cause the spot was vacant DDSS and Sketch left, and Pigsty was on vacation So they wanna know who next up in Canada, and if this is confirmation Im dropping quotes, and Imma lay it all out to take Illipsis (ellipsis) out that conversation! And thats two rounds down, they aint stoppin the flow Next round, Imma talk to your soul And excuse my French - it always comes out when Im talkin to hoes [Round 2: Illipsis] I said, uh Said I dont even have to mention how trash Quebec is... Have to mention how trash Quebec- but I will! Cause Im fuckin petty like that Cop hit me up, tryin to figure out the right match Like, down to battle Red Flag? Id have to be in my bag So instead, they booked his shitty French cousin White Flag We both rep that red and white, so it correlates perfectly Cause work from me turn the leaves of his fleur de lis burgundy But I heard that Krome made powerful moves I said, Cop, youre clownin me, dude Its Westworld, how you see Krome (chrome) gettin broken cause the host is out of the loop Convinced you all to hail a fake Im at a loss - youre the boss, move major weight? Its player piano: aint nobody pushin kis (keys), but still, the song remains the same Bro, its Le Glock du Quebecois Thats the team you rep? Bro, your weak crews French, you all squeeze two TECs? Low-key, I kinda feel I dont believe you yet So I am un-intimidated...by Steel Duceppe! The fuckin Glock du Quebecois Who else is reppin the crew? From what I hear, its Trevy and you, and fuckin Pepe Le Pew And you all detail guns you bought for retail, huh? Pussy with fake stripes - Uh-HUH! A female skunk! But the Glock and the Bloc We cant contrast em for a reason Inflated sense of their importance, no one packed outside their region He came in feelin like he got a real potential as Champion Hell put Quebec on the map, you can expect it to happen Well, the pen that hed clash with is electorate action Pussy, Ill leave your head in a different state for repping separatist factions! Lame-ass! Got the same chance of bein the next leader? You do battles for free, dummy, like Vive le Quebec libre Then abandoned Montreal, like his borders could not contain him I stayed where I am to help it grow, my priorities always stationed This dork want a shot at greatness Well, sorry, Im not to play with Ill put the division before my gains: thats the Order of Operations Look at your past, how it conveys the way youve moved And say it aint the truth, like blood tests arranged to trace your roots Youve engaged in vain pursuits, like when we tried to set this up I declined offers for MASS When we tried lockin it, man had denied wanting the match So the dichotomy vast, homie, Im bodyin Max And Im only dissectin this frog because I wanted a pass in my biology class! Said his hearts in the wrong place Actin like hes plagued by virus When hes anxious-minded, panic placed him in a state of crisis B-Ribbits not built for war Maybe he just aint quite like it Youre a fuckboy with stage fright and 8 Mile-itis! He constructed an impression where you thought Max would shoot me Gun under the sweater, covered in his moms ratatouille See, Krome, he, um, (chromium) out his element and prone to panic Inferno, bet hed try to catch a spark, and still theres noble gasses No reaction! I go Galactus! Im the lone jobber sent for Ill to murder Only one I seen Krome (chrome) bodied on cam is the Silver Surfer! Im bored wit him Really, this the match you givin Lipsis? He a problem in the game? Shit, I bet Patch could fix the glitches No one thought that he would win outside the dudes core base And thats Goldilocks breakfast - a few cornflakes with a lukewarm take So tell Michigan J. Frog that I got the shiv in the same box as Vivica A. Fox Translation: Im leavin Krome (chrome) wit the serial (cereal) scraped off! Its spillin like raindrops At no point shall the bloodlettin cease Im makin Krome (chrome) look bad, pussy: rust never sleeps Two [Round 3: Krome] Aight, we gotta talk, man Punchlines aside, this the third round, and Imma talk to your soul But lemme start this by saying that King Whisper is a fucking horrible name But we gon talk about all the flaws in your whole game plan Bout how being a bland rapper left you with a no-name brand You battled Chedda (cheddar), and that aint put none in your pocket Battled Sketch, the writing was on the wall that you should probably stop it You went to war wit Real Even that wasnt a Deal from which you would profit Then the Chilla shit was cold, but...nobody watched it Truth is, you were supposed to be the next big thing And you aint live up to what any of us expected, King You were that nerd with the great writing, somewhat of a joker Fast-forward to you telling Chilla his mom survived a stroke just so you could stroke her? How much youve changed since you first stepped to the scene That condescending tone that got you known is getting to your head now, it seems All the people you touched with that atheist scheme Made Ill viral, and it spread like an infectious disease But you couldnt brand yourself, and thought King of the Dot would Then your next battle out in Toronto was not good And the relationship between the two divisions? Never been great But you let Pigsty take all the heat for saying the shit you shouldve said in his place! Cause Vancouver always came last when they were checkin for names Theyll book any URL artist before they get you a plate! So you cowered away when those questions were raised The same dude questionin religion just accepted his fate? And its sad, cause youre the one that they respect and they praise! And you never spoke up for your people King Whisper - now I get it! Thats a hell of a name! But that loyalty paid off, right? I mean, hardly, dawg We booked this for VanCity, the card gets dropped And it gets less staff promo than Charron freestyling in a parking lot!?! So I hope you wrote your little heart out, and I hope that you win And maybe if you go viral, itll be like the debts paid And youll get the chance to pay your own flight to Toronto and open up Decade! Good luck! [Round 3: Illipsis] I said...that was real dope Some more shit that wont happen Is if Krome rappin, Krome strappin wit a chrome Magnum Kromes only line is in his jeans Fuck is Krome packin? Can probably bet its no matic (nomadic) like a Cro-Magnon! BOW! His head cave on site, Ill leave bone fragments No, leave brains in ya lap: Jackie Onassis! Ill switch the safety off, searchin, Ill do Krome (Chrome) graphic Then go Incognito so they dont track it! Fuck whatever high school musical that Krome cast in Beam put ya cells on display: now we Chromecastin Shit, when he die, hell probably still be outlived by that ho accent So this fuckin closed-casket gon come wit a closed caption I can barely talk to you, the generic ingenue Still get riddled (Riddle) from the Chamber like its Harry Potter 2! I use the .357 for my Magnum opus Thats the handgun quotient A sawed-off to ya topknot: hell get his man-bun toasted! My guns the motherfucking truth Face facts, the truth hurts Fuck questions, shoot first The clip long as Mooks third! You mad, Max - hurry home Got mad MACs, squirtin those Drive-by, sprayin Krome (chrome): Mad Max: Fury Road Dick wit the shotty Who I shot? Hes probably unimportant But for the chain, he (Cheney) get shot in the fuckin forest like not wearing hunters orange Gettin money off of crime All the cribs I robbed? Ironic...how I copped a Porsche 911 off of inside jobs! The interiors a mixture of vanilla and milk Copped a Carrera Coupe the same color as liberal guilt I reap spoils I been leavin a trail of deceased Royals Dont gas him, man, its nothin out the pump: Peak Oil Who the slickest wit the talk? Of course Im bodyin Max Im gettin money out the bando like foreign property tax No prints, gloves on, burner to his lips Cause when this ratchet kiss a frog, he aint turnin into shit! Im real, boy! Think its funny? Then Im lettin it fly The long nose on a dummy: I aint telin a lie! This couldve been on Lexxs league Still couldnt say I battled (iBattle) a titan (Titen) Gun so big that to reload I actually climbed it Ascendin the stock (stalk) just to load up like Jack and the Giant I ride up, masked up Get you buried, cock-sucker In disguise (the skies), wavin a stick like ya Fairy Godmother He bout to tell me how the white man is really oppressed Bitch, I got your missus in bed refusing to come quietly: resistin arrest! Community Day, she get a nut in the face and Ditto the rest Switch and he get caught with the AR: its a mythical quest, for main static Branchin out? He isnt growin the balls Yellow and Blue - stuck as an Eevie cause he doesnt have the stones to evolve! Youre insignificant, as fiction you consistently produce That you fuckin stitch with unconnected figments of the truth Beat at his own game, not because this undeveloped, gun-obsessive infant really shoot Its just to demonstrate it wasnt less ridiculous than you! A cornball that stays worried bout a punchline count Cause he aint figured out a way to make his punchlines count! Its Illipsis! VanCitys King, killer, Im in business You arent shit, dawg, I talk that shit - its a big difference"

Like mines not the one they had to match the best with! Like mines- Man, forget it But you know its a trap they settin, right? Shit, its a valid question! Ive seen your accolades, and thats when I got apprehensive of the fan perspective Shit, yall only gassed this cretin Since on online forums, hes such a nagging presence A constant whining drone that needs to have attention Outside of that connection Max is just a grasping beg that has to ask for credit like a tax exemption! I bet he claim he handled Jaws like they were at the dentist And this an apt progression? Nah, its chiropractic method! Ill snap his back in seconds, so he can stand corrected! When this was the match suggested, pussy, I was apathetic! Off how we write alone (a loan), I got no interest in principle (principal) Its a bad investment! Lets keep it kosher! You whined (Jew wine) for this pairing like a Manischewitz So Im washin the tool, tryin to make the cut: pass the antiseptic Just give him the large picture: panoramic lenses You are dying just to die, while I lacked incentive This aint even a battle, its a practice session And youre an A.I. bot on the lowest challenge setting!

You need to scratch that noise Your punchlines dont sound better when you spit them in the Batman voice! And tonight, I dont wanna hear any type of aggression Cause being a pussy made you bipolar in half of a second Remember when you dissed Manik and bitched up when he was askin you questions? You hated, and then liked him in the span of a sentence All it took was for Manik to press him to cause manic depression! He rolled up on you, you seemed panicked for help Smart enough to know that native smoke would be bad for your health You fidgety faggot! Who the fuck told you to rap!? The closest you been to being an Alpha was joining a frat! And I aint come to play nice with this weirdo! Im here to bark on him, since nobodys bothered These bullets comin out they shell in the crowd But you goin out solo, since you socially awkward! The shit that you spit put us to sleep And that aint helpin your scene generate more profit Yeah, we cut from a different cloth, and yours got chloroform on it! So go ahead, spit your played-out lies You need an ounce of personality to break down mine Glock party For the down payment, we droppin a body Riskin life to take yours like a kamikaze Clout-chasin, sendin shots to make the news: no paparazzi Or gun-butt to try dentin (trident in) his grill like Maseratis I give a fuck about Illipsis I showed up on my pimp shit The watch called Arthritis: I got a sick wrist Skeleton face on it like the Misfits The hands touchin gold like Midas You rock a Fitbit, nitwit! Man, I swear to God this shit is a joke Youre just the man out West cause the spot was vacant DDSS and Sketch left, and Pigsty was on vacation So they wanna know who next up in Canada, and if this is confirmation Im dropping quotes, and Imma lay it all out to take Illipsis (ellipsis) out that conversation! And thats two rounds down, they aint stoppin the flow Next round, Imma talk to your soul And excuse my French - it always comes out when Im talkin to hoes [Round 2: Illipsis] I said, uh Said I dont even have to mention how trash Quebec is... Have to mention how trash Quebec- but I will! Cause Im fuckin petty like that Cop hit me up, tryin to figure out the right match Like, down to battle Red Flag? Id have to be in my bag So instead, they booked his shitty French cousin White Flag We both rep that red and white, so it correlates perfectly Cause work from me turn the leaves of his fleur de lis burgundy But I heard that Krome made powerful moves I said, Cop, youre clownin me, dude Its Westworld, how you see Krome (chrome) gettin broken cause the host is out of the loop Convinced you all to hail a fake Im at a loss - youre the boss, move major weight? Its player piano: aint nobody pushin kis (keys), but still, the song remains the same Bro, its Le Glock du Quebecois Thats the team you rep? Bro, your weak crews French, you all squeeze two TECs? Low-key, I kinda feel I dont believe you yet So I am un-intimidated...by Steel Duceppe! The fuckin Glock du Quebecois Who else is reppin the crew? From what I hear, its Trevy and you, and fuckin Pepe Le Pew And you all detail guns you bought for retail, huh? Pussy with fake stripes - Uh-HUH! A female skunk! But the Glock and the Bloc We cant contrast em for a reason Inflated sense of their importance, no one packed outside their region He came in feelin like he got a real potential as Champion Hell put Quebec on the map, you can expect it to happen Well, the pen that hed clash with is electorate action Pussy, Ill leave your head in a different state for repping separatist factions! Lame-ass! Got the same chance of bein the next leader? You do battles for free, dummy, like Vive le Quebec libre Then abandoned Montreal, like his borders could not contain him I stayed where I am to help it grow, my priorities always stationed This dork want a shot at greatness Well, sorry, Im not to play with Ill put the division before my gains: thats the Order of Operations Look at your past, how it conveys the way youve moved And say it aint the truth, like blood tests arranged to trace your roots Youve engaged in vain pursuits, like when we tried to set this up I declined offers for MASS When we tried lockin it, man had denied wanting the match So the dichotomy vast, homie, Im bodyin Max And Im only dissectin this frog because I wanted a pass in my biology class! Said his hearts in the wrong place Actin like hes plagued by virus When hes anxious-minded, panic placed him in a state of crisis B-Ribbits not built for war Maybe he just aint quite like it Youre a fuckboy with stage fright and 8 Mile-itis! He constructed an impression where you thought Max would shoot me Gun under the sweater, covered in his moms ratatouille See, Krome, he, um, (chromium) out his element and prone to panic Inferno, bet hed try to catch a spark, and still theres noble gasses No reaction! I go Galactus! Im the lone jobber sent for Ill to murder Only one I seen Krome (chrome) bodied on cam is the Silver Surfer! Im bored wit him Really, this the match you givin Lipsis? He a problem in the game? Shit, I bet Patch could fix the glitches No one thought that he would win outside the dudes core base And thats Goldilocks breakfast - a few cornflakes with a lukewarm take So tell Michigan J. Frog that I got the shiv in the same box as Vivica A. Fox Translation: Im leavin Krome (chrome) wit the serial (cereal) scraped off! Its spillin like raindrops At no point shall the bloodlettin cease Im makin Krome (chrome) look bad, pussy: rust never sleeps Two [Round 3: Krome] Aight, we gotta talk, man Punchlines aside, this the third round, and Imma talk to your soul But lemme start this by saying that King Whisper is a fucking horrible name But we gon talk about all the flaws in your whole game plan Bout how being a bland rapper left you with a no-name brand You battled Chedda (cheddar), and that aint put none in your pocket Battled Sketch, the writing was on the wall that you should probably stop it You went to war wit Real Even that wasnt a Deal from which you would profit Then the Chilla shit was cold, but...nobody watched it Truth is, you were supposed to be the next big thing And you aint live up to what any of us expected, King You were that nerd with the great writing, somewhat of a joker Fast-forward to you telling Chilla his mom survived a stroke just so you could stroke her? How much youve changed since you first stepped to the scene That condescending tone that got you known is getting to your head now, it seems All the people you touched with that atheist scheme Made Ill viral, and it spread like an infectious disease But you couldnt brand yourself, and thought King of the Dot would Then your next battle out in Toronto was not good And the relationship between the two divisions? Never been great But you let Pigsty take all the heat for saying the shit you shouldve said in his place! Cause Vancouver always came last when they were checkin for names Theyll book any URL artist before they get you a plate! So you cowered away when those questions were raised The same dude questionin religion just accepted his fate? And its sad, cause youre the one that they respect and they praise! And you never spoke up for your people King Whisper - now I get it! Thats a hell of a name! But that loyalty paid off, right? I mean, hardly, dawg We booked this for VanCity, the card gets dropped And it gets less staff promo than Charron freestyling in a parking lot!?! So I hope you wrote your little heart out, and I hope that you win And maybe if you go viral, itll be like the debts paid And youll get the chance to pay your own flight to Toronto and open up Decade! Good luck! [Round 3: Illipsis] I said...that was real dope Some more shit that wont happen Is if Krome rappin, Krome strappin wit a chrome Magnum Kromes only line is in his jeans Fuck is Krome packin? Can probably bet its no matic (nomadic) like a Cro-Magnon! BOW! His head cave on site, Ill leave bone fragments No, leave brains in ya lap: Jackie Onassis! Ill switch the safety off, searchin, Ill do Krome (Chrome) graphic Then go Incognito so they dont track it! Fuck whatever high school musical that Krome cast in Beam put ya cells on display: now we Chromecastin Shit, when he die, hell probably still be outlived by that ho accent So this fuckin closed-casket gon come wit a closed caption I can barely talk to you, the generic ingenue Still get riddled (Riddle) from the Chamber like its Harry Potter 2! I use the .357 for my Magnum opus Thats the handgun quotient A sawed-off to ya topknot: hell get his man-bun toasted! My guns the motherfucking truth Face facts, the truth hurts Fuck questions, shoot first The clip long as Mooks third! You mad, Max - hurry home Got mad MACs, squirtin those Drive-by, sprayin Krome (chrome): Mad Max: Fury Road Dick wit the shotty Who I shot? Hes probably unimportant But for the chain, he (Cheney) get shot in the fuckin forest like not wearing hunters orange Gettin money off of crime All the cribs I robbed? Ironic...how I copped a Porsche 911 off of inside jobs! The interiors a mixture of vanilla and milk Copped a Carrera Coupe the same color as liberal guilt I reap spoils I been leavin a trail of deceased Royals Dont gas him, man, its nothin out the pump: Peak Oil Who the slickest wit the talk? Of course Im bodyin Max Im gettin money out the bando like foreign property tax No prints, gloves on, burner to his lips Cause when this ratchet kiss a frog, he aint turnin into shit! Im real, boy! Think its funny? Then Im lettin it fly The long nose on a dummy: I aint telin a lie! This couldve been on Lexxs league Still couldnt say I battled (iBattle) a titan (Titen) Gun so big that to reload I actually climbed it Ascendin the stock (stalk) just to load up like Jack and the Giant I ride up, masked up Get you buried, cock-sucker In disguise (the skies), wavin a stick like ya Fairy Godmother He bout to tell me how the white man is really oppressed Bitch, I got your missus in bed refusing to come quietly: resistin arrest! Community Day, she get a nut in the face and Ditto the rest Switch and he get caught with the AR: its a mythical quest, for main static Branchin out? He isnt growin the balls Yellow and Blue - stuck as an Eevie cause he doesnt have the stones to evolve! Youre insignificant, as fiction you consistently produce That you fuckin stitch with unconnected figments of the truth Beat at his own game, not because this undeveloped, gun-obsessive infant really shoot Its just to demonstrate it wasnt less ridiculous than you! A cornball that stays worried bout a punchline count Cause he aint figured out a way to make his punchlines count! Its Illipsis! VanCitys King, killer, Im in business You arent shit, dawg, I talk that shit - its a big difference",

Tonight, I dont need a reaction I mean, yall asked for this matchup, with this nerd you been gassin And this shit is just odd Yall made him a God Illipsis, the only rapper so gay that his name is a pause! And yall brought me far West for some bars So like saloon doors, Imma open up swinging Get ready to die Cause your past opponents treated this like moot court And showed up just pretending to try (trial) See, this whole Vancouver division is built to put you in a better position I get it, but listen We fight for who next up, they comparin the writtens We both got drive, but like a Tesla, my energy different! And I aint even charged for this battle I guess La Sparka helped me get this far So Im in debt to Lars cause I aint need gas to get here But this trip dependin on the plug like an electric car So whats good, pussy? I expect you to say you dont believe in the shots I hear it a lot, so I been contemplatin Lettin the Glock spice up that conversation Im well-equipped, and the heat wet him til he drop like condensation Boy, I never missed (mist) Now the chrome in his grill, and he caught under pressure Or he facin the Eagle like Conor McGregor Man, I came to put this man on a shirt I see him outside, then Im airin for sure Quick to draw in public, and thatll blow his face up like a caricature Explains how you nearly died vers Sketch, and tonights the same verdict Pushin your luck, but the gamble aint worth it This another near-death experience, just know practice makes perfect Cause you know whats at stake, right? Either took this for the paid flight Or to give an arrogant bitch that Ray Rice straight right And it remains to be seen if I drop a body in plain sight Remains to be seen? Body in plain sight? Just do the math - it aint rocket science But me leavin Earth increases your odds of dyin Concealin the type of piece (peace) that wont stop the violence And I aint worried at all...like Illipsis driving with the cops behind him! See, I traveled all summer, my stock kept getting stronger You havent done shit, but Willie and Sparka got your back, and theyll always treat you proper Until Jisho takes your place, youre the only main-page battle on the roster So they put the best that they could get, against the best they had to offer [Round 1: Illipsis] Fuck all that! Said, right the fuck away, lets keep it 100, cause this pansys threatened! This is war and peace, laurel wreaths to a Panzer engine! Blood moon on the rise, he see the waxing crescent Inferno, the flames illuminate the path hes treaded You can hear the damned lamenting Past regrets when they cant clasp redemption You cant fathom the depths But you can hazard a guess where Max is headin Flashback to how this match incepted Talkback wanna broadcast how rad his pen is Like mines not the one they used to clash with legends! Like mines not the one they had to match the best with! Like mines- Man, forget it But you know its a trap they settin, right? Shit, its a valid question! Ive seen your accolades, and thats when I got apprehensive of the fan perspective Shit, yall only gassed this cretin Since on online forums, hes such a nagging presence A constant whining drone that needs to have attention Outside of that connection Max is just a grasping beg that has to ask for credit like a tax exemption! I bet he claim he handled Jaws like they were at the dentist And this an apt progression? Nah, its chiropractic method! Ill snap his back in seconds, so he can stand corrected! When this was the match suggested, pussy, I was apathetic! Off how we write alone (a loan), I got no interest in principle (principal) Its a bad investment! Lets keep it kosher! You whined (Jew wine) for this pairing like a Manischewitz So Im washin the tool, tryin to make the cut: pass the antiseptic Just give him the large picture: panoramic lenses You are dying just to die, while I lacked incentive This aint even a battle, its a practice session And youre an A.I. bot on the lowest challenge setting! Fight back! Shit, I dont even have to press him I just want it called early like a snap election He tryin to draft amendments to enact protection They gave me a bill to kill: this wont get past the Senate! His writings the same on every card, a standard run-of-the-mill Damn, these rats relentless! My bad, thats a Magic reference - you dont have to get it! A simple favor could send him up in the air: Anna Kendrick Cause I make an acid bath when I get handed lemons Youre French? Well, this verse, I brought a chopper to the palace exit Maxime! Yas, queen, you gettin Antoinetted! Thats beheaded So France is gettin cut, this storys Anglo-centric Or a fade knock his soul out the astral spectrum! Put a bottle to your waves like a stranded message! How I fight in the Cage? Dirty: Bad Lieutenant! Youre a placid, pleasant, standard template That cant mask inspection of when he act aggressive No, a hackish yes-man with a lack of ethics That dick-suck for a quick buck and fan consensus No! A bland, synthetic, trash, generic, average, precious, angry peasant Arrival correlates exactly when the brand descended Cause if hes what you push as talent, then its sad and desperate! You are bottom-of-the-barrel, fucking rancid remnants Fucking leech on this league that has latched and bled it And thats why Krome and Champ contention is such a hackneyed premise Ill leave him hanging from the chain like he can have the necklace This shits a mirror-match? Im leavin with a cracked reflection, and a scattered semblance in the glass Ive stepped in You are dog shit, I am cosmic: thats expensive One round, and I aint even have to mention how trash Quebec is Lets go [Round 2: Krome] Man, I already have a headache Yo, look, that little growling sound you make when you rap is the most cringe-worthy shit Ive ever heard in my life! You need to scratch that noise Your punchlines dont sound better when you spit them in the Batman voice! And tonight, I dont wanna hear any type of aggression Cause being a pussy made you bipolar in half of a second Remember when you dissed Manik and bitched up when he was askin you questions? You hated, and then liked him in the span of a sentence All it took was for Manik to press him to cause manic depression! He rolled up on you, you seemed panicked for help Smart enough to know that native smoke would be bad for your health You fidgety faggot! Who the fuck told you to rap!? The closest you been to being an Alpha was joining a frat! And I aint come to play nice with this weirdo! Im here to bark on him, since nobodys bothered These bullets comin out they shell in the crowd But you goin out solo, since you socially awkward! The shit that you spit put us to sleep And that aint helpin your scene generate more profit Yeah, we cut from a different cloth, and yours got chloroform on it! So go ahead, spit your played-out lies You need an ounce of personality to break down mine Glock party For the down payment, we droppin a body Riskin life to take yours like a kamikaze Clout-chasin, sendin shots to make the news: no paparazzi Or gun-butt to try dentin (trident in) his grill like Maseratis I give a fuck about Illipsis I showed up on my pimp shit The watch called Arthritis: I got a sick wrist Skeleton face on it like the Misfits The hands touchin gold like Midas You rock a Fitbit, nitwit! Man, I swear to God this shit is a joke Youre just the man out West cause the spot was vacant DDSS and Sketch left, and Pigsty was on vacation So they wanna know who next up in Canada, and if this is confirmation Im dropping quotes, and Imma lay it all out to take Illipsis (ellipsis) out that conversation! And thats two rounds down, they aint stoppin the flow Next round, Imma talk to your soul And excuse my French - it always comes out when Im talkin to hoes [Round 2: Illipsis] I said, uh Said I dont even have to mention how trash Quebec is... Have to mention how trash Quebec- but I will! Cause Im fuckin petty like that Cop hit me up, tryin to figure out the right match Like, down to battle Red Flag? Id have to be in my bag So instead, they booked his shitty French cousin White Flag We both rep that red and white, so it correlates perfectly Cause work from me turn the leaves of his fleur de lis burgundy But I heard that Krome made powerful moves I said, Cop, youre clownin me, dude Its Westworld, how you see Krome (chrome) gettin broken cause the host is out of the loop Convinced you all to hail a fake Im at a loss - youre the boss, move major weight? Its player piano: aint nobody pushin kis (keys), but still, the song remains the same Bro, its Le Glock du Quebecois Thats the team you rep? Bro, your weak crews French, you all squeeze two TECs? Low-key, I kinda feel I dont believe you yet So I am un-intimidated...by Steel Duceppe! The fuckin Glock du Quebecois Who else is reppin the crew? From what I hear, its Trevy and you, and fuckin Pepe Le Pew And you all detail guns you bought for retail, huh? Pussy with fake stripes - Uh-HUH! A female skunk! But the Glock and the Bloc We cant contrast em for a reason Inflated sense of their importance, no one packed outside their region He came in feelin like he got a real potential as Champion Hell put Quebec on the map, you can expect it to happen Well, the pen that hed clash with is electorate action Pussy, Ill leave your head in a different state for repping separatist factions! Lame-ass! Got the same chance of bein the next leader? You do battles for free, dummy, like Vive le Quebec libre Then abandoned Montreal, like his borders could not contain him I stayed where I am to help it grow, my priorities always stationed This dork want a shot at greatness Well, sorry, Im not to play with Ill put the division before my gains: thats the Order of Operations Look at your past, how it conveys the way youve moved And say it aint the truth, like blood tests arranged to trace your roots Youve engaged in vain pursuits, like when we tried to set this up I declined offers for MASS When we tried lockin it, man had denied wanting the match So the dichotomy vast, homie, Im bodyin Max And Im only dissectin this frog because I wanted a pass in my biology class! Said his hearts in the wrong place Actin like hes plagued by virus When hes anxious-minded, panic placed him in a state of crisis B-Ribbits not built for war Maybe he just aint quite like it Youre a fuckboy with stage fright and 8 Mile-itis! He constructed an impression where you thought Max would shoot me Gun under the sweater, covered in his moms ratatouille See, Krome, he, um, (chromium) out his element and prone to panic Inferno, bet hed try to catch a spark, and still theres noble gasses No reaction! I go Galactus! Im the lone jobber sent for Ill to murder Only one I seen Krome (chrome) bodied on cam is the Silver Surfer! Im bored wit him Really, this the match you givin Lipsis? He a problem in the game? Shit, I bet Patch could fix the glitches No one thought that he would win outside the dudes core base And thats Goldilocks breakfast - a few cornflakes with a lukewarm take So tell Michigan J. Frog that I got the shiv in the same box as Vivica A. Fox Translation: Im leavin Krome (chrome) wit the serial (cereal) scraped off! Its spillin like raindrops At no point shall the bloodlettin cease Im makin Krome (chrome) look bad, pussy: rust never sleeps Two [Round 3: Krome] Aight, we gotta talk, man Punchlines aside, this the third round, and Imma talk to your soul But lemme start this by saying that King Whisper is a fucking horrible name But we gon talk about all the flaws in your whole game plan Bout how being a bland rapper left you with a no-name brand You battled Chedda (cheddar), and that aint put none in your pocket Battled Sketch, the writing was on the wall that you should probably stop it You went to war wit Real Even that wasnt a Deal from which you would profit Then the Chilla shit was cold, but...nobody watched it Truth is, you were supposed to be the next big thing And you aint live up to what any of us expected, King You were that nerd with the great writing, somewhat of a joker Fast-forward to you telling Chilla his mom survived a stroke just so you could stroke her? How much youve changed since you first stepped to the scene That condescending tone that got you known is getting to your head now, it seems All the people you touched with that atheist scheme Made Ill viral, and it spread like an infectious disease But you couldnt brand yourself, and thought King of the Dot would Then your next battle out in Toronto was not good And the relationship between the two divisions? Never been great But you let Pigsty take all the heat for saying the shit you shouldve said in his place! Cause Vancouver always came last when they were checkin for names Theyll book any URL artist before they get you a plate! So you cowered away when those questions were raised The same dude questionin religion just accepted his fate? And its sad, cause youre the one that they respect and they praise! And you never spoke up for your people King Whisper - now I get it! Thats a hell of a name! But that loyalty paid off, right? I mean, hardly, dawg We booked this for VanCity, the card gets dropped And it gets less staff promo than Charron freestyling in a parking lot!?! So I hope you wrote your little heart out, and I hope that you win And maybe if you go viral, itll be like the debts paid And youll get the chance to pay your own flight to Toronto and open up Decade! Good luck! [Round 3: Illipsis] I said...that was real dope Some more shit that wont happen Is if Krome rappin, Krome strappin wit a chrome Magnum Kromes only line is in his jeans Fuck is Krome packin? Can probably bet its no matic (nomadic) like a Cro-Magnon! BOW! His head cave on site, Ill leave bone fragments No, leave brains in ya lap: Jackie Onassis! Ill switch the safety off, searchin, Ill do Krome (Chrome) graphic Then go Incognito so they dont track it! Fuck whatever high school musical that Krome cast in Beam put ya cells on display: now we Chromecastin Shit, when he die, hell probably still be outlived by that ho accent So this fuckin closed-casket gon come wit a closed caption I can barely talk to you, the generic ingenue Still get riddled (Riddle) from the Chamber like its Harry Potter 2! I use the .357 for my Magnum opus Thats the handgun quotient A sawed-off to ya topknot: hell get his man-bun toasted!

When I feel like I'm all out of love And my time is up It scares me Judge us fairly If only music could make us understand I swear sometimes I hear a ghost in the radio I went from station to station searching for Somewhere safe to go I'm not the only one who's seen it So there's no question, I believe it I'm not crazy Cause I can't move 'til it makes me Please try to save as many as you can Could it be you and I are a sign of the times? Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times? Well it's something you can't deny Go 'head and ask me why For the meaning And if you think you're dreaming Oh I have got the perfect song for you If our time it just right, I won't have to say it again Will my two cents be enough For you to play it again? I put some weight on it Repetition, can change the human condition Oh, you need to listen if it's the last thing that you do Could it be you and I are a sign of the times? Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times? Well it's something you can't deny Go 'head and ask me why For the meaning And if you think you're dreaming Oh I have got the perfect song for you Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
